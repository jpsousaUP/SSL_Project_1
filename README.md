AI4LMD: Self-Supervised Learning with MANTA and XIRIS

## Overview

This project aims to create a new representation of the images images using AI4LMD. The inputs are XIRIS and MANTA images (2 channels combined), and the outputs are 4 levels of Laser power.

## TO DO

- [ ] Combine Laser power and velocity to predict the Energy density
- [ ] Train with more epochs

## Notes

- Using data augmentation we can improve the robustness: when evaluated with only the Manta images it got much better accuracy.

## Acknowledgments

This project is based on the cookiecutter data science project template.
